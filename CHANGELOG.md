# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented. The version here coincides with releases on Github and tags on
Docker Hub. After 0.0.2, versions correspond with commits and automated
builds on Docker Hub.

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

## [master](https://github.com/expfactory/survey-generator/tree/master) (master)
 - fixing bug with numeric field, changing text with regular expression (0.0.2)
 - adding this CHANGELOG and releases too
 - initial release (0.0.1)
